I am a PhD student in the Department of Electrical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Science Bangalore. Prior to this, I have worked as a Data Scientist in IBM India Pvt. Ltd after completing my Masters in Control and Computing from Indian Institute of Technology Bombay.

During my stint in IBM, I have worked on some client-facing projects which involved deep learning applications in the domain of object detection and tracking of persons in video feed. I have also worked on NLP projects in my leisure hours.

As a novice PhD student working with [Dr. Sriram Ganapathy](http://www.leap.ee.iisc.ac.in/sriram/), I am presently learning the basics of Speech Processing and hope to contribute to the field by means of Deep Learning. I am associated with the wonderful group of people (and researchers) at [LEAP Lab](http://www.leap.ee.iisc.ac.in).

Academics takes up most of my time. However, I had started learning the piano before the pandemic. I hope to play [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7maJOI3QMu0) and [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imGaOIm5HOk) someday.

For more of my academic projects check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/Soumya-Dutta/) page.
